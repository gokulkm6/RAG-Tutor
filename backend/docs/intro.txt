Generating More Data:

To create 100,000 words and sentences, you can expand on these ideas using various methods:

Sentence Generation Using Templates:
You can use a sentence template like:

"The [algorithm] [action] the [type] of [data] using [technique]."

"In [type of learning], the model [action] to [goal] from [input data]."

Examples:

"The decision tree splits the dataset using feature values to predict outcomes."

"In supervised learning, the model learns to map inputs to corresponding outputs from labeled data."

Synonym Substitution:

Replace terms with their synonyms to create variations of sentences. For instance, replace "model" with "algorithm," "classifier," or "predictor."

Textual Data Augmentation:

Swap adjectives and verbs while maintaining the meaning. E.g., "improves accuracy" becomes "enhances performance" or "boosts precision."

Use of Pretrained Models:
You can leverage GPT models (like this one) or other large language models to generate a large number of machine learning-related sentences. You can use a script that automatically generates this content in bulk.

Web Scraping:
You can scrape publicly available articles, research papers, blogs, and tutorials related to machine learning. Websites like arXiv
, Towards Data Science
, and Medium
 have lots of content that could be used for data collection.

Books & Research Papers:
You can use machine learning textbooks and research papers to extract sentences. The natural language in these documents will be very relevant and diverse.
